- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucemFere
- 👀 I'm interested in writing code for public use Telegram bots. And, in the future, for business areas, such as food for delivery, or the sale of goods with delivery to other regions. Drawing up algorithms for automating sales, and automating the processes of compiling 
-     applications, without the participation of operators.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to code with PyCharm. I just started recently and I'm really into it.
- 💞️ I'm looking for the opportunity to cooperate with people who already have experience in this, or with those who can teach or give advice on how to automate payments in Telegram bots through the API.
- 📫 How to contact me? Just email me 👉 maxim.alexandrovich.vtk91@gmail.com or in Telegram 👉 @luceem_ferre
