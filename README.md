- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucemFere
- 👀 I'm interested in the code for Telegram public use bots.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to code with PyCharm. I just started recently and I'm really into it.
- 💞️ I'm looking for the opportunity to cooperate with people who already have experience in this, or with those who can teach or give advice on how to automate payments in Telegram bots through the API.
- 📫 How to contact me? Just email me 👉 maxim.alexandrovich.vtk91@gmail.com or in Telegram 👉 @luceem_ferre
